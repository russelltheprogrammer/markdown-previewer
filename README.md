# Challenge?
## To Build a Markdown Previewer

## User Stories To Fullfill

- User Story #1: I can see a ```textarea``` element with a corresponding ```id="editor"```.

- User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding ```id="preview"```.

- User Story #3: When I enter text into the ```#editor``` element, the ```#preview``` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

- User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the ```#editor``` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the ```#preview``` element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

- User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the ```#editor``` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

- User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the ```#editor``` field should be rendered as HTML in the ```#preview``` element.

- Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as ```br``` (line break) elements.
